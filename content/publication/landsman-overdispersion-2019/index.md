abstract: Overdispersion models have been extensively studied for correlated normal
  and binomial data but much less so for correlated multinomial data. In this work,
  we describe a multinomial overdispersion model that leads to the specification of
  the first two moments of the outcome and allows the estimation of the global parameters
  using generalized estimating equations (GEE). We introduce a Global Blinding Index
  as a target parameter and illustrate the application of the GEE method to its estimation
  from (1) a clinical trial with clustering by practitioner and (2) a meta-analysis
  on psychiatric disorders. We examine the impact of a small number of clusters, high
  variability in cluster sizes, and the magnitude of the intraclass correlation on
  the performance of the GEE estimators of the Global Blinding Index using the data
  simulated from different models. We compare these estimators with the inverse-variance
  weighted estimators and a maximum-likelihood estimator, derived under the Dirichlet-multinomial
  model. Our results indicate that the performance of the GEE estimators was satisfactory
  even in situations with a small number of clusters, whereas the inverse-variance
  weighted estimators performed poorly, especially for larger values of the intraclass
  correlation coefficient. Our findings and illustrations may be instrumental for
  practitioners who analyze clustered multinomial data from clinical trials and/or
  meta-analysis.
