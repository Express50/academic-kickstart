abstract: 'Background: In pandemics, local hospitals need to anticipate a surge in
  health care needs. We examined the modelled surge because of the coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that was used to inform the early hospital-level response
  against cases as they transpired. Methods: To estimate hospital-level surge in March
  and April 2020, we simulated a range of scenarios of severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, using
  the best available data at the time. We applied outputs to hospital-specific data
  to estimate surge over 6 weeks at 2 hospitals (St. Michael’s Hospital and St. Joseph’s
  Health Centre). We examined multiple scenarios, wherein the default (R0 = 2.4) resembled
  the early trajectory (to Mar. 25, 2020), and compared the default model projections
  with observed COVID-19 admissions in each hospital from Mar. 25 to May 6, 2020.
  Results: For the hospitals to remain below non-ICU bed capacity, the default pessimistic
  scenario required a reduction in non-COVID-19 inpatient care by 38% and 28%, respectively,
  with St. Michael’s Hospital requiring 40 new ICU beds and St. Joseph’s Health Centre
  reducing its ICU beds for non-COVID-19 care by 6%. The absolute difference between
  default-projected and observed census of inpatients with COVID-19 at each hospital
  was less than 20 from Mar. 25 to Apr. 11; projected and observed cases diverged
  widely thereafter. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential
  than uncertainty in clinical severity. Interpretation: Scenario-based analyses were
  reliable in estimating short-term cases, but would require frequent re-analyses.
  Distribution of the city’s surge was expected to vary across hospitals, and community-level
  strategies were key to mitigating each hospital’s surge.'
