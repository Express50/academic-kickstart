abstract: "Background: A hospital-level pandemic response involves anticipating local\
  \ surge in healthcare needs. Methods: We developed a mechanistic transmission model\
  \ to simulate a range of scenarios of COVID-19 spread in the Greater Toronto Area.\
  \ We estimated healthcare needs against 2019 daily admissions using healthcare administrative\
  \ data, and applied outputs to hospital-specific data on catchment, capacity, and\
  \ baseline non-COVID admissions to estimate potential surge by day 90 at two hospitals\
  \ (St. Michael\x92s Hospital [SMH] and St. Joseph\x92s Health Centre [SJHC]). We\
  \ examined fast/large, default, and slow/small epidemics, wherein the default scenario\
  \ (R0 2.4) resembled the early trajectory in the GTA. Results: Without further interventions,\
  \ even a slow/small epidemic exceeded the city\x92s daily ICU capacity for patients\
  \ without COVID-19. In a pessimistic default scenario, for SMH and SJHC to remain\
  \ below their non-ICU bed capacity, they would need to reduce non-COVID inpatient\
  \ care by 70% and 58% respectively. SMH would need to create 86 new ICU beds, while\
  \ SJHC would need to reduce its ICU beds for non-COVID care by 72%. Uncertainty\
  \ in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical\
  \ severity. If physical distancing reduces contacts by 20%, maximizing the diagnostic\
  \ capacity or syndromic diagnoses at the community-level could avoid a surge at\
  \ each hospital. Interpretation: As distribution of the city\x92s surge varies across\
  \ hospitals over time, efforts are needed to plan and redistribute ICU care to where\
  \ demand is expected. Hospital-level surge is based on community-level transmission,\
  \ with community-level strategies key to mitigating each hospital\x92s surge. Keywords:\
  \ COVID-19, pandemic preparedness, mathematical model, transmission modelCompeting\
