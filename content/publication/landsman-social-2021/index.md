abstract: Cities are complex systems, and understanding their structure is critical
  for multiple applications. However, traditional urban planning is challenged by
  the dynamics of the urban system. Fortunately, in recent years, multiple datasets
  reflecting human activity in nearly real-time have become available. This paper
  leverages geo-tagged data from VKontakte, Google Places social media and Nash Petersburg
  urban issue-reporting portal for building a multi-layered social activity network
  and revealing the structure of the city through the community structure in this
  network. The ability of this structure to capture meaningful socio-economic patterns
  across the city is evaluated. Results will aid urban, transportation, infrastructural
  planning, policy-making, real estate and socio-economic development initiatives.
