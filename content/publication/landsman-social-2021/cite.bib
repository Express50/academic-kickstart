 abstract = {Cities are complex systems, and understanding their structure is critical for multiple applications. However, traditional urban planning is challenged by the dynamics of the urban system. Fortunately, in recent years, multiple datasets reflecting human activity in nearly real-time have become available. This paper leverages geo-tagged data from VKontakte, Google Places social media and Nash Petersburg urban issue-reporting portal for building a multi-layered social activity network and revealing the structure of the city through the community structure in this network. The ability of this structure to capture meaningful socio-economic patterns across the city is evaluated. Results will aid urban, transportation, infrastructural planning, policy-making, real estate and socio-economic development initiatives.},
