abstract: Cities are complex systems and understanding their structure is critical
  for multiple applications. However, traditional urban planning is challenged by
  the dynamics of the urban system. Fortunately, in recent years, multiple datasets
  reflecting human activity in nearly real-time have become available. This paper
  leverages geo-tagged VKontakte and Google Places social media data for building
  three different networks between locations across Saint-Petersburg and revealing
  the structure of the city through the community structure of those networks. Comparative
  analysis of the discovered network structure and its ability to capture meaningful
  socio-economic patterns across the city is evaluated. Results will aid urban, transportation,
  infrastructural planning, policy-making, real estate and socio-economic development
  initiatives.
