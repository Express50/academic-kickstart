abstract: 'Background: We compared the risk of, testing for, and death following COVID-19
  infection across three settings (long-term care homes (LTCH), shelters, the rest
  of the population) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. Methods: We sourced
  person-level data from COVID-19 surveillance and reporting systems in Ontario, and
  examined settings with population-specific denominators (LTCH residents, shelters,
  and the rest of the population). We calculated cumulatively, the diagnosed cases
  per capita, proportion tested for COVID-19, daily and cumulative positivity, and
  case fatality proportion. We estimated the age- and sex-adjusted relative rate ratios
  for test positivity and case fatality using quasi-Poisson regression. Results: Between
  01/23/2020-05/25/2020, we observed a shift in the proportion of cases: from travel-related
  and into LTCH and shelters. Cumulatively, compared to the rest of the population,
  the number of diagnosed cases per 100,000 was 59-fold and 18-fold higher among LTCH
  and shelter residents, respectively. By 05/25/2020, 77.2% of LTCH residents compared
  to 2.4% of the rest of the population had been tested. After adjusting for age and
  sex, LTCH residents were 2.5 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3-2.8) more
  likely to test positive. Case fatality was 26.3% (915/3485), 0.7% (3/402), and 3.6%
  (506/14133) among LTCH residents, shelter population, and others in the GTA, respectively.
  After adjusting for age and sex, case fatality was 1.4-fold (95%CI: 1.1-1.9) higher
  among LTCH residents than the rest of the population. Interpretation: Heterogeneity
  across micro-epidemics among specific populations in specific settings may reflect
  underlying heterogeneity in transmission risks, necessitating setting-specific COVID-19
  prevention and mitigation strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have
  declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work was supported by the Canadian
  Institutes of Health Research Foundation Grant (FN 13455), the Ontario Early Researcher
  Award (ER17-13-043), and the St. Michael’s Hospital Foundation Research Innovation
  Council’s 2020 COVID-19 Centre Research Award. Author DeclarationsI confirm all
  relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics
  committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body
  that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Reported
  COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Public Health Ontario (PHO) integrated Public
  Health Information System (iPHIS), via the Ontario COVID-19 Modelling Consensus
  Table, and with approval from the University of Toronto Health Sciences REB (protocol
  No. 39253). All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the
  appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical
  trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with
  an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such
  study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration
  ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively,
  please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not
  registered in advance).Yes I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines
  and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other
  pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.YesThe findings of this
  study are supported by 1) data from the Public Health Ontario (PHO) integrated Public
  Health Information System (iPHIS), 2) the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care Long-Term
  Care Homes Tracker; and 3) the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS). The
  iPHIS and Long-Term Care Homes Tracker were accessed via the Ontario COVID-19 Modelling
  Consensus Table. The OLIS data were accessed via ICES. In addition, data that are
  sourced publicly are made available in the paper as appendix or as per the referenced
  links.'
