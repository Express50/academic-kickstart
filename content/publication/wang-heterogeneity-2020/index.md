abstract: 'Background: Congregate settings have been disproportionately affected by
  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our objective was to compare testing for, diagnosis
  of and death after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  infection across 3 settings (residents of long-term care homes, people living in
  shelters and the rest of the population). Methods: We conducted a population-based
  prospective cohort study involving individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Greater
  Toronto Area between Jan. 23, 2020, and May 20, 2020. We sourced person-level data
  from COVID-19 surveillance and reporting systems in Ontario. We calculated cumulatively
  diagnosed cases per capita, proportion tested, proportion tested positive and case-fatality
  proportion for each setting. We estimated the age- and sex-adjusted rate ratios
  associated with setting for test positivity and case fatality using quasi-Poisson
  regression. Results: Over the study period, a total of 173 092 individuals were
  tested for and 16 490 individuals were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed
  a shift in the proportion of cumulative cases from all cases being related to travel
  to cases in residents of long-term care homes (20.4% [3368/16 490]), shelters (2.3%
  [372/16 490]), other congregate settings (20.9% [3446/16 490]) and community settings
  (35.4% [5834/16 490]), with cumulative travel-related cases at 4.1% (674/16490).
  Cumulatively, compared with the rest of the population, the diagnosed cases per
  capita was 64-fold and 19-fold higher among long-term care home and shelter residents,
  respectively. By May 20, 2020, 76.3% (21 617/28 316) of long-term care home residents
  and 2.2% (150 077/6 808 890) of the rest of the population had been tested. After
  adjusting for age and sex, residents of long-term care homes were 2.4 (95% confidence
  interval [CI] 2.2–2.7) times more likely to test positive, and those who received
  a diagnosis of COVID-19 were 1.4-fold (95% CI 1.1–1.8) more likely to die than the
  rest of the population. Interpretation: Long-term care homes and shelters had disproportionate
  diagnosed cases per capita, and residents of long-term care homes diagnosed with
  COVID-19 had higher case fatality than the rest of the population. Heterogeneity
  across micro-epidemics among specific populations and settings may reflect underlying
  heterogeneity in transmission risks, necessitating setting-specific COVID-19 prevention
  and mitigation strategies.'
